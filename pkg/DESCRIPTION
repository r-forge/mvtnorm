Description: Computes multivariate normal and t probabilities, quantiles, random deviates, 
  and densities. Log-likelihoods for multivariate Gaussian models and Gaussian copulae 
  parameterised by Cholesky factors of covariance or precision matrices are implemented 
  for interval-censored and exact data, or a mix thereof. Score functions for these 
  log-likelihoods are available. A class representing multiple lower triangular matrices 
  and corresponding methods are part of this package.
